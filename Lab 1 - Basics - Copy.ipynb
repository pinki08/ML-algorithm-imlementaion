    "To predict the outputs of all data-points in a dataset $X$ using multiple linear models $h^{(1)}_\\theta, h^{(2)}_\\theta, h^{(3)}_\\theta, \\dots$, we can simply multiply the dataset matrix by another matrix $H$. Each column of the matrix $H$ corresponds to the parameters vector of one model. So our predicted outputs will be a matrix $X H$, as illustrated in the following figure.\n",

There are several possible markers, some of them are: `\"x\"`, `\"o\"`, `\".\"`, `\"+\"`, `\">\"` ... etc. You can also use any predefined letter as a marker, for example, to use the letter R, your marker should be: `\"$R$\"`.\n",
